## Modules

Many modules are supported (you can see [here]()) but to name a few we have:

1. Translation
    * The user can translate given text to English with `.tr Halo daar`
    * You can specify the language to translate to as well with `.tr:af Lekker man`
    * Powered by Google Translate
2. Rot13
    * You can do Rot13 using `.rot13 <Text>`
3. Ping
    * Let's you ping a endpoint with `.ping <addr/domain>`
